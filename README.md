# Problem
Finding a good movie to watch can be difficult. There are so many genres and movies
to choose from. Oftentimes, one faces the dilemma of choosing between spending a
lot of time trying to discern or find a good movie or possibly wasting two hours on a
subpar or mediocre movie experience. The problem is then to create a website that
assists the user to quickly and easily choose a movie to watch with reasonable
expectation of satisfaction.

# Constraints
The project must be completed by December 18, 2017.
The clients are local cinemas in the New York City and Hoboken area in partnership
with Netflix.
These clients expect a website that will make the user watch more movies.s
The budget will be $20 000 for the initial implementation and creation of the website,
and $8000 dollars per month for maintenance.
Website must provide recommendations that both highlight popular titles as well as
accommodate the specific tastes of the user.

# Solution
We will rent out an office space (1000-1500 sq. ft) through squarefoot.com (max
$6750/month).
Seventy dollars of the monthly budget shall be allocated to connect this office space
to the internet.
We will register or buy the domain name “freepopcorn.com”.
We will hire a small development team of four or five people to create the website.
We will develop a website called FreePopcorn. FreePopcorn will offer easy and
accessible movie suggestions for the user to chose from and will have the following
features:
A frontpage that prominently shows the posters of featured/popular movies
that week.
These frontpage posters shall also have snippets or the first half of the first
paragraph of each review.
There will be a prominent sidebar along the top of the website that contains
dropdown menus allowing users to pick movies by genre, popularity, tags, etc.
This dropdown menu shall also contain a randomizing button which directs the
user to a random individual movie page on the site.
The website should feature movies of a variety of genres (this should be
reflected in an abundant selection when users pick movies by genre, tags, etc.)
Clicking on the posters shall bring the user to the movie’s individual page.
Each movie’s individual page shall display the various posters and promotional
materials for the movie (including trailers and teaser videos).
Each movie’s individual page shall prominently display the tags that the movie
falls under.
Along the side of each movie’s individual page shall be the posters of movies
that fall under similar tags, sorted by similarity from top to bottom.
Clicking on a tag from a movie’s individual page shall bring the user to the pick
movie by tags page sorted according to that tag (i.e. this action is equivalent
to the user searching for a movie by that specific tag).
Each movie’s individual page shall display the reviews of that movie.
These reviews will either be aggregated from other movie review websites or
shall be written by the web development team themselves.
There will be a Netflix-driven (i.e. the data is taken from Netflix itself) page on
the website that specifically displays popular titles on Netflix to the user.
Each member of the development team shall be paid $3000/year to develop the
website and shall use computers that are already in their possession to do so (owning
a computer is a prerequisite for the job).
We will allocate the remainder of the budget to the maintenance of the website
(required bugfixing, updating features, etc).

# Success
The project will be deemed a success when FreePopcorn meets all prerequisites, is
feature-complete and is accessible via the internet to the public; that is:
When clients approve of the website’s functionality after acceptance testing
When all planned features are fully implemented and functional, that is:
When the Netflix-driven page consistently and accurately displays
information pertinent to the popularity of Netflix titles directly taken
from Netflix itself (i.e. the what’s popular/trending section on a typical
Netflix homescreen)
When all buttons (including the posters on the frontpage) are clickable
and lead users to the intended pages on the website.
When the movie selection exceeds 50 titles per genre, thus providing an
abundant and varied selection of movies.
When all movies on the site are accurately and completely categorized
into the appropriate genres and tags.
When the reviews are easily readable (reasonable size font and color)
and support distinct and standardized conclusions about the quality of a
movie experience (i.e. no review should confuse the reader about the
quality of a movie experience, and the format or style with which the
critique concludes should be consistent - not thumbs up for one movie,
three out of five stars for another movie, etc.)
When it takes no more than 3 clicks for a user to get to a movie’s
individual page, thus ensuring that recommendations are easily
accessible.
When the frontpage accurately and consistently shows featured/popular
movies each week (this information will be taken from the websites of
movie theatres).
When all “prominent” features are either of large size (40% or more of
the screen taken) or of high contrast colors (of higher saturation hues
that are dissimilar from background hues).
If FreePopcorn remains functional and widely used after implementation
So long as consistent maintenance is performed (i.e. bug removal and server
upkeep)
